Twitter Clone A front-end clone of the Twitter user interface, built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project focuses on recreating the look and feel of Twitter to practice building responsive, component-based websites.
### Twitter UI Clone

This project is a hands-on exercise in building a modern, responsive web UI from scratch using Tailwind CSS. The focus was on faithfully recreating the core look and feel of the Twitter feed and its main components, aiming to sharpen my front-end development skills, especially with a utility-first CSS framework.

**Key Features Implemented:**
* **Responsive Layout:** Mobile-first design that adapts smoothly to tablets and desktops.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Built reusable UI components for the Sidebar, Tweet, and Trending sections.
* **Utility-First Workflow:** Leveraged Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and styling directly within the HTML markup.

**Built With:**
* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS
